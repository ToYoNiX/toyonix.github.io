👋 Hey there! Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I’m Assem, a final-year Computer Science student and backend engineer passionate about DevOps, Linux, and open-source technologies. I enjoy building efficient systems, exploring new tools, and contributing to others’ work on GitHub and similar platforms.

I can build computers, manage them as desktops or servers, and automate workflows on them as well. My main tools include Linux, Docker, Bash, and Ansible. I have multiple projects underway, including my own personal homelab.

I’m also a backend engineer working with Node.js, MongoDB, SQL, and Express to build efficient and scalable backends. Additionally, I enjoy building lightweight interfaces using HTMX.

Here, I share what I build, break, fix, and discover along the way — from personal experiments to solving real-world engineering challenges.
