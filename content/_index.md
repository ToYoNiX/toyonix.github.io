ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Welcome to my corner of the internet.

Iâ€™m a final-year Computer Science student and a backend engineer whoâ€™s driven by goals, curiosity, and hands-on learning. I love working with DevOps tools, Linux environments, and open-source technologies â€” especially when I get to turn ideas into real projects.

Here, I share what I build, break, fix, and discover along the way â€” from personal experiments to solving real-world engineering challenges.
