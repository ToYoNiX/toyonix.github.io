[{"content":"Portfolio - Blog\n👋 Hey there! Welcome to my corner of the internet.\nI’m Assem, a final-year Computer Science student and backend engineer passionate about DevOps, Linux, and open-source technologies. I enjoy building efficient systems, exploring new tools, and contributing to others’ work on GitHub and similar platforms.\nI can build computers, manage them as desktops or servers, and automate workflows on them as well. My main tools include Linux, Docker, Bash, and Ansible. I have multiple projects underway, including my own personal homelab.\nI’m also a backend engineer working with Node.js, MongoDB, SQL, and Express to build efficient and scalable backends. Additionally, I enjoy building lightweight interfaces using HTMX.\nHere, I share what I build, break, fix, and discover along the way — from personal experiments to solving real-world engineering challenges.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"Welcome to by Articles!\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"blog"},{"content":"⚠️ Work in Progress — Cool Stuff Coming Soon!\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/portfolio/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"portfolio"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
