[{"content":"Portfolio - Blog\n👋 Hey there! Welcome to my corner of the internet.\nI’m a final-year Computer Science student and a backend engineer who’s driven by goals, curiosity, and hands-on learning. I love working with DevOps tools, Linux environments, and open-source technologies — especially when I get to turn ideas into real projects.\nHere, I share what I build, break, fix, and discover along the way — from personal experiments to solving real-world engineering challenges.\n","date":"7 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"Welcome to by Articles!\n","date":"7 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"blog"},{"content":" A Bit of History — My Home Lab Journey # I started my home-lab journey in January 2025 (about 11 months before writing this article). Saying that I learned a lot is a huge understatement. I had been interested in home servers long before that, but that’s when I finally took action.\nI didn’t want to buy fancy hardware just to let it collect dust. So, following Techno Tim’s golden advice, I began with what I already had:\na desktop PC and a laptop.\nFirst Steps — Running Services at Home # I installed a few services on my main PC. Everything worked perfectly — until I left the house.\n“How do I access my stuff from outside my home network?”\nAfter researching, I discovered two ways:\n1️⃣ Expose services publicly using a domain + public IP\n2️⃣ Create a secure VPN tunnel back home\nIn Egypt, getting a public static IP is expensive and annoying.\nAlso, exposing services publicly as a beginner = pure anxiety. 😅\nSo I went with the second option: an overlay VPN using Tailscale / ZeroTier.\nIt solved both problems:\n✅ No need for a public IP\n✅ Secure access with proper authentication\nBoom! I could now access everything from anywhere.\nThe Next Problem — Power Consumption # But… everything was running on my desktop PC.\n⚠️ That meant:\nIt had to be on 24/7\nIt consumed a ton of electricity\nI needed a more efficient solution.\nSo I built a VPN router — a regular router that also connects to my overlay VPN, consuming just a tiny amount of power.\nWith it, I could:\n✅ Remotely turn on my PC using Wake-on-LAN (WOL)\n✅ Shut it down over SSH\nThis dropped my power usage significantly while keeping remote access alive.\nPower Cuts… The Real Villain # Then another issue hit — unstable electricity.\nPower would drop for a split second and come back again. On a server, that’s a disaster:\n❌ Hardware stress\n❌ Data corruption\n❌ Failed WOL behavior after the outage\n⚙️ Quick WOL Clarification # Wake-on-LAN doesn’t need the PC to be fully powered on —\nbut it DOES need the PC to still be receiving a tiny bit of power.\nFor WOL to work properly, the system must have:\n✅ WOL enabled in BIOS/UEFI\n✅ The network card powered in standby mode\n✅ A clean shutdown or sleep state (S5/S3) — not a full power cut\nIf the electricity goes out — even for a split second — the PC loses that standby power.\nWhen that happens:\n⚠️ The network card “forgets” what packets to listen for\n⚠️ WOL becomes completely disabled\n⚠️ You must physically press the power button to reinitialize the components\nSo… a power flicker = WOL broken until someone physically presses the power button.\nAs a remote user, that’s game over. 😬\nEnter: The UPS # I bought a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) — a must-have for any home lab.\nIt fixed:\n✅ Data integrity\n✅ Safe shutdowns\n✅ Continuous standby power for WOL\nBut another problem appeared…\nA desktop PC is so power-hungry that the UPS only lasted 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, my router alone could last around 3 hours.\nNot great.\nI even considered building a battery-powered ESP32 shutdown controller as a workaround…\nThe Game-Changer — Thin Clients # Then one day, wandering around a PC parts mall, I found a gem:\n🔹 Thin clients\nTiny, super-efficient computers built for light workloads.\nPower consumption:\nDesktop PC idle: 45W\nThin client under load: 10–20W 🤯\nThey’re cheap. They run Linux and Docker. And they sip electricity like royalty.\nI bought one. Installed everything. Tested all my services.\nResults? Stunning.\nWith PC + router → UPS lasted 5 minutes\nWith thin client + router → 2 hours of runtime\n🎉 Same services\n🎉 Less heat\n🎉 More uptime\n🎉 Tiny power bill\nWhere I Am Now # After almost a year of learning, breaking things, fixing things, and upgrading…\nI ended up with:\n✅ A low-power home server\n✅ Designed with downtime and reliability in mind\n✅ Secure remote access from anywhere\n✅ Hardware and electrical efficiency dialed in\nAnd that’s just the hardware side!\nThe software setup — reverse proxying, free domains from DuckDNS, SSL certificates, automation… — that’s a whole adventure too.\nWhat’s Next? # In the next sections, I’ll walk you through:\n🚀 What hardware to choose\n🔌 How to handle power and uptime\n🔒 Secure remote access\n⚙️ Smart home server architecture\n💡 Everything I learned in one year\nSo grab a snack — and welcome to the journey! 🧑‍💻🌍\n⚠️ Work in Progress — Cool Stuff Coming Soon!\n","date":"7 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/build-a-low-power-home-server-without-breaking-the-bank/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Build a Low-Power Home Server Without Breaking the Bank!","type":"blog"},{"content":"⚠️ Work in Progress — Cool Stuff Coming Soon!\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/portfolio/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"portfolio"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
