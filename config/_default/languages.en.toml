  bio = "Hi! I’m Assem, a final-year Computer Science student at Misr University for Science and Technology with a strong passion for Linux, open-source technologies, and especially DevOps. Outside of tech, I enjoy helping people and students broaden their knowledge—whether through study sessions, online platforms, or casual discussions. I’m driven by the goal of becoming a software engineer, and I’m continuously growing my skills through academic studies, hands-on projects, and contributions to open-source communities. I love tackling complex challenges, learning new technologies, and sharing knowledge along the way.A little bit about you"
